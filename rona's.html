<h2 style="text-align: left-side;">Hi, I'm Rona! I'm a sophomore student passionate about learning and growing every day. Iâ€™ll be turning 20 this May 1, and I'm excited about the journey ahead. This webpage is a little space where I can share my interests, experiences, and thoughts. Stay tuned for more!</h2>
<p> I love reading novel books, and watching movies and series. My favorite movie is Mona Lisa Smile, which where led by Julia Roberts who plays the art history professor, Katherine Ann Watson. While my favorite series is the Game of Thrones. And recently, I just finished watching the K-drama adaptation of a webtoon story, titled "Study Group".</p>
